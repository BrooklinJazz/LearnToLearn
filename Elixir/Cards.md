## basics
- generate a new project `mix new <projectname>`
- compile module and run in iex `iex -S mix`
- modules and methods. run using module.method or module.method()
- list = [] (just like array)
  - convention is to use double quotes throughout all of your elixir code ["one", "two"]
- reload/recompile code in iex using `recompile`

## functional design patterns
- OOP tends to have class methods that work on it's local data
